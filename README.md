# LAB - Class 08

## Project: Access Control

### Author: Jacob Dang

### Problem Domain
Using two servers, the lab is meant to demonstrate two functioning APIs and how to implement them to become a fully functional, authenticated and authorized API Server. Routes that end up performing those actions in our API/Database need to be protected by both a valid user and that userâ€™s permissions. Access controls are specified as:
- Regular users can READ
- Writers can READ and CREATE
- Editors can READ, CREATE, and UPDATE
- Administrators can READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE
